WV2Prototype
================

This is a prototype showing how to create a View. It is preferred that the views are created as DataTemplates with properties on their elements bound to their corresponding view models, since this will help avoinding code-behind anti-pattern. The clients are however free to create views as they wish.
Views can be created in WPF or in Avalonia (multiplatform version of WPF). Note that WPF views will only run on Windows.
Both Avalonia and WPF views can host HTML/Javascript applications within themselves.
